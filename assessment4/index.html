      <h1>Final Project Reflection and Critical Analysis</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This project explores the design and development of an interactive
          basketball strategy tool built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          Konva.js. The tool allows users to simulate offensive and defensive
          plays using drag-and-drop mechanics and visual markers, aiming to
          enhance strategic understanding through intuitive, game-inspired
          interaction design.

        <h2>Judgments of Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          As a sport lover and especially basketball, I always enjoy exploring
          different aspects of the game and the thing I focus on the most is how
          the game is operated. Because of that, in this project, the primary
          purpose was to create an interactive and intuitive platform for
          visualizing basketball plays-bring the theoretical aspect of this
          sport to everyone. I wanted all users, not only those with expertise
          like coaches, players but also everyone who is new to basketball to
          simulate offensive and defensive strategies or even create their own
          plays by moving players and the ball on a virtual court. The interface
          supports the experience of drag-and-drop and draws different arrow
          variants on players path for separate actions to create a play.
        </p>

        <h2>Judgments of Worth</h2>
        <p>
          The key values besides innovation and novelty were clarity and
          accessibility, clarity and accessibility. When creating a tool, what
          users need is to be simple enough and can easily get acquainted. This
          interface was designed so that even those who do not have any
          knowledge or experience about basketball can still be interested
          in-the highlight is the basketball court contains icons that can
          interact in real time. Basketball is a simple and complex sport at the
          same time with lots of professional terms. Therefore, the explanation
          for different terms and reflect fair presentation of both defensive
          and defensive tactics were also important. Users can slowly discover
          and go into the tactic aspect of basketball in their own way.
        </p>

        <h2>Judgments of Framing</h2>
        <p>
          The project was intentionally framed as a browser-based tool using
          only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Konva.js library used for
          canvas-based interactions. Although it is impossible to put complex
          concepts such as 3D of physical movement, it helped me focus on
          developing the part I have. From the beginning, the sound for the
          interface was something I have considered carefully but I realized how
          the operation of the tool is not closely link with the sound, so I
          find it is unnecessary. In addition, I also decided not to include a
          full playbook-saving system and pre-design tactics to keep the scope
          achievable within the timeframe.
        </p>

        <h2>Judgments of Appearance</h2>
        <p>
          The visual style pursued minimalist style with simple button
          highlights and icons help the interface feel more engaging and become
          accessible for younger and color users. The color of the pith and the
          player was carefully selected to both highlight the players as well as
          show the opposition between the two teams. For tactical clarity,
          players were displayed with two contrasting colors and the ball was
          distinct in size and style.
        </p>
        <img src="images/full.png" alt="court" class="image1" />
        <p>
          Arrows were designed to somewhat simulate the action to be performed
          and has different colors to distinguish that action by which factors
          are performed.
        </p>
        <div class="image-row">
          <img src="images/color1.png" alt="color 1" class="image2" />
          <img src="images/color2.png" alt="color 2" class="image2" />
          <img src="images/color3.png" alt="color 3" class="image2" />
        </div>
        <div class="image-row">
          <img src="images/shape1.png" alt="shape 1" class="image2" />
          <img src="images/shape2.png" alt="shape 2" class="image2" />
          <img src="images/shape3.png" alt="shape 3" class="image2" />
        </div>
        <p>
          In this part, I also removed some of the arrow variants, the most
          typical is the idea of moving the ball and the player at the same time
          as the Zic Zac arrow. I could not do this because the Zic Zac drawing
          algorithms were too complex when sometimes it did not go properly
          where I want and moving two icons at once was also too confusing.
        </p>

        <h2>Judgments of Quality</h2>
        <p>
          On a technical level, I chose to use Konva.js for it ease in handling
          drag-and-drop objects, layered graphics and shape animations. The
          arrow drawing and formation choosing functions were brought by the
          optimization of the library in processing and reading information. I
          also implemented move history tracking to support multiple actions:
          undo, leave clone behind and animation. I avoided more complex tools
          and focused on interaction design.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Judgments of Composition</h2>
        <p>
          The layout and user interface were carefully composed to maintain
          balance between function and space although I did not do everything
          perfectly when I did not calculate the difference when the interface
          was displayed on a larger screen. For the visual part, the court was
          placed in the middle of the page and had a sufficient ratio to not
          make the icons inside too confused but also not overwhelming the
          interactive elements. The players and ball icons in each formation
          were also considered the position to follow the real-life tactics and
          still show the difference of each formation. Visual balance was
          maintained through the logical arrangement of interactive elements,
          which was each group of relevant button or bar was stand side by side.
        </p>
        <div class="image-row">
          <img src="images/bar1.png" alt="bar 1" class="image4" />
          <img src="images/bar2.png" alt="bar 2" class="image4" />
        </div>
        <p>
          For the interaction, I want to have a balanced experience between the
          veteran and the newbie. Users may not know anything about basketball
          but still feel interested in moving the icons around and seeing the
          animation. For those who are knowledgeable, the interface also has
          support tools like choosing between different formation and action to
          take the experience to another level.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Judgments of Navigation</h2>
        <p>
          During development, I prioritized interaction design first because I
          understand this is the most crucial part of my project. I focused on
          the user interaction experience so I spent time developing and testing
          on each function: drag-and-drop, drawing movement path and animation
          to work properly the way I want. That was the reason I removed the
          complex features to avoid feature creep and ensure a polished core
          experience. The UI feedback-like highlighting the active tool mode was
          also a key part of the project to enhance navigation and reduce user
          confusion. This helps users understand what they can do with interface
          without being overwhelmed with too much information.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Through iterative design and technical refinement, the project
          successfully balances usability, visual clarity, and tactical depth.
          Strategic judgments evolved over time, prioritizing simplicity and
          interactivity. The result is a practical, visually engaging tool for
          basketball planning that reflects thoughtful design decisions across
          appearance, purpose, navigation, and user experience.
