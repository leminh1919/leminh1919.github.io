    <p id="list">
      The first thing I paid attention to is the background music of the

      listening to the shows
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your

      3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </p>
    <p id="list">
      I spent a lot of time interacting with the 3D model of the building. It is

      of the Concert Hall
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the

    </p>
    <p id="list">
      The most common action was clicking on the interactive elements which will

    <p id="question">
      5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </p>
    <p id="list">
      The intended primary goal appears to be educating viewers about the
      process and meaning behind the construction of the Walt Disney Concert
      Hall by Frank Gehry and his team in a unique and lively style
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </p>
    <p id="list">
      The website has used different components of digital media like visuals,
      sounds or interactions to go deep into small parts of a complex design
      idea and tell a complete story
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time?
    </p>
    <p id="list">
      Viewers can interact with the website in any way and they are all
      effective. A short visit can give people a panoramic view of the project
      but spending more time for each part will let them dig deeper about the
      vision of Frank Gehry
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
      interacted with over time?
    </p>
    <p id="list">
      The project is really detailed and some information is likely to be missed
      on the first interaction. It encourages viewers to spend more and more
      time or even come back later to notice some small details that may have
      been missed last time and discover further into the project
    </p>

    <p id="question">
      9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?

      combination of different elements of digital media and freedom when
