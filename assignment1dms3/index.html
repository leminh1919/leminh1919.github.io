    <ol>
      <li>
        It belongs to the simulation sandbox genre, focusing on the elements and
        components of the ecosystem
      </li>

      <li class="line">Three examples of software in this genre:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          SimEarth: A simulation of planet's development from microbes to human
          civilization
        </li>
        <li>
          Sandboxels: A pixel-based sandbox with chemical and physical elements
        </li>
        <li>
          The Powder Toy: A sandbox allow users to interact and experiment with
          different materials
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li class="line">The program’s interactive mechanics:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Arrange element: Combine and arrange natural factors with any order to
          create a complete ecosystem
        </li>
        <li>
          Control resources limitations: The space is limited so users must
          balance each different element and think carefully before adding
        </li>
        <li>
          Ecological balance: Simulating a miniature ecosystem needs all
          conditions like oxygen and carbon dioxide to balance
        </li>
        <li>
          Interactions between elements: Flush according to physical and
          chemical principles like sand submerged in the water
        </li>
        <li>
          The environment’s impact on organisms: The development of living
          organisms depends on the environmental conditions
        </li>
        <li>
          Time control: Users can set the time quickly or slowly to see the
          development of the environment
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li class="line">The program’s mechanics indicate its genre:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Arbitrarily arranging and adjusting the elements are the crucial
          factors that every sandbox application must have
        </li>
        <li>
          Accurately simulate the way an active ecosystem defined for the
          concept of simulation
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li class="line">The program’s mechanics are novel:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unique graphic style when combining pixels and realistic graphics like
          water creates an interesting visual experience
        </li>
        <li>
          Simulate the cycle of the ecosystem overtime creating an mini world
          that is really developing and existing, making users feel its souls
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li class="line">The program’s mechanics are missing:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The diversity of organisms: The limitations of the number of biomes so
          it is impossible to simulate the important factor of the ecosystem
          like food chains or the relationship between species
        </li>
        <li>
          Weather change: The weather and natural phenomena affect the ecosystem
          will increase the diversity and authenticity of the system
        </li>
        <li>
          Temperature adjustment: The adjustment of the temperature will open
          the ability to observe the adaptation of the environment and organisms
          with different temperatures
        </li>
        <li>
          Interactions between users: Observing and interacting with other users
          works is really interesting and increasing the uniqueness of the
          application
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li class="line">
        This application is mainly aimed at those who are passionate about
        science, biology and creative thoughts with an friendly interface,
        focusing on creative and educational experiences
      </li>

      <li class="line">Annoying aspects about interacting with it:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The elements sometime move too chaotic will cause a bad control
          experience when we can not put them in the positions we want
        </li>
        <li>
          The resources are not really diverse, leading to the loss of appeal
          after we have experienced a time
        </li>
        <li>
          The lack of tutorial is easy to make new users surprised and confused
          when not understanding how the application works
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li class="line">Enjoyable aspects about interacting with it:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The interface and interactions of the application are very simple that
          we do not have to think too much while using it
        </li>
        <li>
          Full control allows us to be creative with anything we want and not
          under pressure from achieving any results
        </li>
        <li>
          Observing and enjoying the natural scenery gives us a refreshing and
          peaceful feeling
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
